# SSL Cert Expiration calendar tool (certexpire2ical)

This tool parses single ssl certificates or a complete directory and subdirs and searches for X509 SSL Certificates and extracts certificate expiration times from the ssl certs.
As output it create a calendar data file (in ics File format), which can be added to calendar programs (like Apple iCal, iOS or Android calenders) to get a overview and alerts about expiring certificates.
